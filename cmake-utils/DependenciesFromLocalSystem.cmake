# This configuration file can be used to build CryFS against local dependencies instead of using Conan.
#
# Example:
# $ mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -DDEPENDENCY_CONFIG=../cmake-utils/DependenciesFromLocalSystem.cmake
#
# Note that this is only provided as an example and not officially supported. Please still open issues
# on GitHub if it doesn't work though.
#
# There's another file in this directory, DependenciesFromConan.cmake, which, well, gets the dependencies from
# Conan instead of from the local system. This is the default. You can also create your own file to tell the build
# how to get its dependencies, for example you can mix and match, get some dependencies from Conan and others
# from the local system. If you mix and match Conan and local dependencies, please call conan_basic_setup()
# **after** running all find_package() for your local dependencies, otherwise find_package() might also find
# the versions from Conan.
#
# Note that if you use dependencies from the local system, you're very likely using different versions of the
# dependencies than were used in the development of CryFS. The official version of each dependency required is
# listed in conanfile.py. Different versions might work but are untested. Please intensively test your CryFS build
# if you build it with different versions of the dependencies.
